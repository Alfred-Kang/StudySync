## Introduction

***This website was created for a school assignment, neither the company nor its products are legitimate.***

## Overview
GenericApparel is an online clothing ecommerce store that offers high-quality apparel at low prices. The company is committed to providing customers a wide range of products that not only looks good, but also feels good to wear.

## Research

### E-commerce 
When researching on what website to create, there were a few key factors I kept in mind. 

Firstly, we were tasked to create a **static** website, which meant that the website's main objective is to display information.

Secondly, I wanted to do something that I can have free creativity on, which meant that instead of revamping an existing company's website, I decided to create my own fake company website, GenericApparel.

And lastly, I wanted something to add filters, micro interactions, and potentially a search bar feature, and thus I decided on an e-commerce website.

### Inspiration
I searched up some big e-commerce sites such as [Uniqlo](https://www.uniqlo.com/), [Zara](https://www.zara.com/), and [Nike](https://www.nike.com/) as inspiration when designing the wireframe for GenericApparel, and implemented some of my favourite UI/UX features from each of them.
