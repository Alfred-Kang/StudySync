Document your study sessions and engage in friendly competition to earn coins to enhance your virtual experience by acquiring rooms, cosmetics, and various assets that enable personalization of your avatar!

## Research

### Gamified Websites
While researching on what website to create, I took into account our assignment's main requirements: 1. Gamification, 2. API Implementation. Therefore, I thought about the API implementation, and decided that I wanted to attempt to use RestDB to create a simple signin account system. I decided to research some gamified websites for my idea, and remembered three apps that exploded in popularity back when I was in secondary school: Yeolpumta, Forest, and Bondee

### Inspiration

#### [Yeolpumta](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ypt-yeolpumta/id1441909643)
Yeolpumta, a highly popular app during my study days, thrived due to its competitive edge. With peers vying to outdo each other in study hours, its gamification concept effectively motivated studying. Its group, country, and global leaderboards fueled daily study habits and healthy competition, making it an ideal fit for our student and school app.

#### [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)
In researching the app Forest, we were drawn to its productivity feature, which incentivizes users to set goals and earn rewards based on their productivity time. We integrated a similar system into our game to encourage user engagement and collaboration in studying, allowing users to set goals and study together with their preferred level of commitment.

#### [Bondee](https://bondee.com/main)
A popular app, Bondee, developed by a Singapore-based tech firm, is widely used by both youths and adults. It's a virtual social networking platform known for its customizability and interactive features, facilitating connections and personalization within the metaverse. Inspired by its success, we've decided to incorporate a similar customization feature into our game to encourage daily logins for studying with friends and family.

Not to mention, the 3D room feature provided by Bondee greatly aligns with what we wanted to design for our 3D section of the assignment!
